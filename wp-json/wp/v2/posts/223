This practice helps in maintaining a healthy weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span><i class=\"fas fa-arrow-right\"><\/i><\/span><strong>Fresh, Whole Foods<\/strong>:  <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>French meals often feature fresh, seasonal ingredients and whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins (like fish and poultry), and whole grains. These provide essential nutrients while keeping calorie intake in check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span><i class=\"fas fa-arrow-right\"><\/i><\/span><strong>Daily Physical Activity<\/strong>:  <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking is a common form of exercise in France.

Enjoying meals with family and friends, and taking time to appreciate the flavors and textures, contributes to a positive relationship with food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span><i class=\"fas fa-arrow-right\"><\/i><\/span><strong>Moderate Alcohol Consumption<\/strong>:  <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wine is often consumed in moderation with meals in France.
