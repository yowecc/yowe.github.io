Grease four 6-ounce ramekins with butter and dust with cocoa powder or flour. This ensures the cakes release easily after baking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Melt Chocolate and Butter<\/strong>: In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the chopped chocolate and butter together until smooth. Stir occasionally to combine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mix Sugar and Eggs<\/strong>: In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract until well combined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Combine<\/strong>: Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and stir until smooth. Add the flour and gently fold it in until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fill Ramekins<\/strong>: Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bake<\/strong>: Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still soft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Serve<\/strong>: Carefully remove the ramekins from the oven and let them cool for 1-2 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of each ramekin, then invert each cake onto a serving plate. Dust with confectioners&#8217; sugar if desired and serve immediately with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enjoy<\/strong>: Dig in and enjoy the warm, gooey center of your homemade molten chocolate cake!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span><i class=\"fas fa-arrow-right\"><\/i><\/span>Tips: <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Timing is crucial for achieving the perfect molten center. Start checking the cakes around the 10-minute mark, as oven temperatures can vary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can prepare the batter ahead of time and refrigerate it in the ramekins. Bring them to room temperature before baking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiment with different types of chocolate for variations in flavor intensity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This molten chocolate cake recipe is sure to satisfy any chocolate lover&#8217;s cravings with its luscious texture and rich flavor.
